        <h1> Honkai: Star Rail</h1>
        <p> Honkai: Star Rail is the most recent game I've picked up, and it's safe to say that I'm absolutely hooked on it. I love the turn-based RPG aspect of the game, I like how every character's weapon is unique to them, and I enjoy the humor and references within the dialogue. Since it's brand new, I'm taking my time exploring and progressing the story. But as for my overall impressions of it so far, this game does a great job of putting you in the protagonist's shoes, raising the stakes with every decision you make, hoping that you haven't ruined everything with the press of a button.  </p>
