        <h1> Kingdom Hearts </h1>
        <p>Kingdom Hearts is a Disney/Final Fantasy crossover game with its own identity. Even though I don't own every game in the series, it hasn't stopped me from following the story and wanting to see how it goes. Although I don't own this game, my favorite from the series is Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories because I like the two-sided story, and most of my favorite characters are from this game. A game I do own is the Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. I enjoy battling with the dream eaters and trying different strategies during the boss fights. </p>
